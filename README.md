# TagTeam
## A MagTag project to let 4 of them communicate between them.

### Prerequisites

This uses the [Adafruit MagTag Library][1] and the CircuitPython version of
[asyncio][2]. An easy way to install both on your MagTag is by using
[circup][3]:

```console
circup install adafruit_magtag
circup install asyncio
```

### Installing/coding

Copy the code from `src` to your MagTag and create a `secrets.py` from the
template. Be sure to never check your secrets.py into the git repo.

Get full on Hackermans on the code.
